# Activity report

## Survey

- December 2022 - March 2023, $n=100$ respondents
- <https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/>
- [IRB protocol](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/hrp-591.html) and full data cleaning, viz workflow openly shared

## Lessons learned

- Many respondents are sharing data
  - Ethical concerns may restrict 
- Fewer sharing materials or code
- Opportunities to enhance knowledge about open science practices
- (Very hard to distribute surveys widely)

## Bootcamp

- August 2023
- <https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/bootcamp-2023/>
