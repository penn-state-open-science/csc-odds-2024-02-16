# Homework

## Quick questions

- What do you wish that “past you” knew about making your work more open, transparent, and reproducible?
- What practices have you *changed* (how has your workflow changed)?
- If you've engaged in open science practices, which ones?
- What have you *learned* by engaging in these practices?

# Activity report

## Survey

- December 2022 - March 2023, $n=100$ respondents
- <https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/>
- [IRB protocol](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/hrp-591.html) and full data cleaning, viz workflow openly shared

![Is there a reproducibility crisis in your area of research?](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/include/img/fig-repro-crisis-your-area-1.png){width=80%}

![How much benefit would you derive from a center at Penn State focused on supporting the adoption of best practices in data management and sharing, code sharing, open science, and reproducible research?](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/include/img/fig-benefit-from-psu-ctr-1.png)

## Lessons learned

- Many respondents are sharing data
  - Ethical concerns may restrict 
- Fewer sharing materials or code
- Opportunities to enhance knowledge about open science practices
- (Very hard to distribute surveys widely)
